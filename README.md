Pin Generator v.02

This script can be used to general a custom length list of numbers for use with brute force tools.  
The list can contain all numbers in a range, or numbers that form a pattern.  The output file  
can be broken up by file size.

No arguments are needed but can be used for better customization.  User will be prompted for the range of the length of the pin if it is not entered.  

-m or --min_length sets the minimum length of the PIN.  
-x or --max_length sets the maximium length of the PIN.    
-o Specify a specific output directory  
-s Split the results into multiple files based on file size in MB.  
--quick Limits the results to simple patterns like all the same digits or sequential numbers for faster results.  
--all Print all numbers in the given range instead of just patterns.  
  
This is a learning project and hopefully will eventually be part of a bigger tool.  Feel free to reach out to loukrawczyk1@gmail.com with any bugs,
